        First, enter the recovery phrase from your Farcaster settings below (not
        the recovery phrase from your connected wallet).

        Crosscaster needs your recovery phrase to cast on your behalf.{' '}
        <Link href="https://t.me/c/1449330344/1448">
          When the hubs launch on Farcaster
        </Link>
        , the recovery phrase will no longer be needed. Instead, you will be
        able to delegate casting rights to Crosscaster.

        But for now it is what it is. The recovery phrase will be securely
        stored on a centralized backend to cast every tweet that you post on
        Twitter. In my defense,{' '}

        so your recovery phrases are ironclad.

      <BodyText>
        And, after all, it's just Farcaster recovery phrases. What could a
        hacker do with it? Steal your casts?

      <BodyText>
        Anyway, enter your recovery phrase below. When you close or refresh this
        website all the data will be gone â€” again, nothing is stored here.
